## Project Description 
This project is a **Library Management Software**, named Libri. It allows a user to Login into their account and have control over their library like: 
* Add, Remove and Update Books 
* View available books and issued books 
* Add, Remove and Update Members 
* View Members 
* Issue Books to members 
* Etc. 
## Certificate 
This is to certify that this project has been made by me, **Mohammad Muzammil Khan** of class **XII-B1**, under the guidance of my Informatics Practices teacher **Ms. Sheetal** and has been completed successfully. 
## Acknowledgment
I would like to express my special thanks to my teacher **Ms. Sheetal** as well as our principal **Ms. Parul Tyagi** who gave me the golden opportunity to do this wonderful project on the topic of **Database connectivity with Java programming Language and MySql**, which also helped me in doing a lot of research and I came to know so many new things. I am really thankful to them. 
 
Secondly I would also like to thank my parents and friends who helped me a lot in finalizing this project within the limited time frame. 
## Requirements 
* Java IDE NetBeans 
* MySQL 
* Knowledge of MySQL (Create Database, Create Table, Insert, Select, Update, Delete & Drop etc.).
* Basic Knowledge of Designing Java UI Frame.
## Project Structure
Libri has a Login page (“Login.java”) which shows up as soon as the application is launched. After entering the correct details, a new frame (“MainFrame.java”) is loaded where user can use Libri as they like.  

MainFrame has all of the controls, including, add/remove/update books/members and also shows all issued/available books and issue books to members within two tabs (Books and Members).  

Each button on MainFrame opens another frame which is dedicated to the function described on button. For Example; if user clicks “Add Book” button, a new frame will load to add book to the data base.  

Once the user is done with a frame, opened via MainFrame, they can click either “Close” button or regular “x” button, it disposes the frame without closing the application as the close operation has been set to dispose on close instead of exit on close.
## Database Structure
Database is automatically created on a successful login (see Project Source Code Part Two in "Project File.pdf"). Database name is libri and it has three tables, i.e., books, issuedBooks, members.
